    5.Implement a TrailObject class. It should inherit the GameObject class and should have a constructor
which takes an additional "lifetime" integer. The TrailObject should disappear after a "lifetime" amount of
turns. You must NOT edit any existing .cs file. Then test the TrailObject by adding an instance of it in the
engine through the AcademyPopcornMain.cs file.
