*********************************************  Methods Tasks  ***********************************************************

	1.	Write a method that asks the user for his name and prints “Hello, <name>” (for example, “Hello, Peter!”).
Write a program to test this method.

	2.	Write a method GetMax() with two parameters that returns the bigger of two integers. Write a program that reads
3 integers from the console and prints the biggest of them using the method GetMax().

	3.	Write a method that returns the last digit of given integer as an English word.
Examples: 512 => "two", 1024 => "four", 12309 ? "nine".

	4.	Write a method that counts how many times given number appears in given array. Write a test program to check if
the method is working correctly.
	
	5.	Write a method that checks if the element at given position in given array of integers is bigger than its two
neighbors (when such exist).

	6.	Write a method that returns the index of the first element in array that is bigger than its neighbors, or -1, if
there’s no such element.!!!Use the method from the previous exercise.
	
	7.	Write a method that reverses the digits of given decimal number. Example: 256 => 652

	8.	Write a method that adds two positive integer numbers represented as arrays of digits
(each array element arr[i] contains a digit; the last digit is kept in arr[0]). Each of the numbers that will be added
could have up to 10 000 digits.

	9.	Write a method that return the maximal element in a portion of array of integers starting at given index. Using
it write another method that sorts an array in ascending / descending order.
