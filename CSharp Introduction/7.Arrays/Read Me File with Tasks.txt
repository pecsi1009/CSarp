*********************************************  Arrays Tasks  ***********************************************************

	1.	Write a program that allocates array of 20 integers and initializes each element by its index multiplied by 5.
Print the obtained array on the console.
	
	2.	Write a program that reads two arrays from the console and compares them element by element.

	3.	Write a program that compares two char arrays lexicographically (letter by letter).

	4.	Write a program that finds the maximal sequence of equal elements in an array.
		Example: {2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1} ? {2, 2, 2}.

	5.	Write a program that finds the maximal increasing sequence in an array. 
Example:{3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 4} ? {2, 3, 4}.

	6.	Write a program that reads two integer numbers N and K and an array of N elements from the console.
Find in the array those K elements that have maximal sum.

	7.	Sorting an array means to arrange its elements in increasing order. Write a program to sort an array.
Use the "selection sort" algorithm: Find the smallest element, move it at the first position, find the smallest from
the rest, move it at the second position, etc.

	8.	Write a program that finds the sequence of maximal sum in given array. Example:
	{2, 3, -6, -1, 2, -1, 6, 4, -8, 8} ? {2, -1, 6, 4}
	Can you do it with only one loop (with single scan through the elements of the array)?

	9.	Write a program that finds the most frequent number in an array. 
Example:	{4, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 4, 9, 3} ? 4 (5 times)

	10.	Write a program that finds in given array of integers a sequence of given sum S (if present).
Example:	 {4, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 8}, S=11 ? {4, 2, 5}	

	11.	Write a program that finds the index of given element in a sorted array of integers by using the binary search
algorithm (find it in Wikipedia).
