*********************************************  Strings-and-Text-Processing-Tasks  ***********************************************************

	1.	Describe the strings in C#. What is typical for the string data type? Describe the most important methods of
the String class.

	2.	Write a program that reads a string, reverses it and prints the result at the console.
Example: "sample" => "elpmas".
	
	3.	Write a program to check if in a given expression the brackets are put correctly.
			
	Example of correct expression: ((a+b)/5-d).
	Example of incorrect expression: )(a+b)).

	4.	Write a program that finds how many times a substring is contained in a given text (perform case insensitive search).

	Example: The target substring is "in". The text is as follows:
		/------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			We are living in an yellow submarine. We don't have anything else. Inside the submarine is very tight.
			So we are drinking all the day. We will move out of it in 5 days.
		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/
	The result is: 9.

	5.	You are given a text. Write a program that changes the text in all regions surrounded by the tags <upcase>
and </upcase> to uppercase. The tags cannot be nested.
	
	Example:
		/------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			We are living in a <upcase>yellow submarine</upcase>. We don't have <upcase>anything</upcase> else.
		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/
	The expected result:
		/------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			We are living in a YELLOW SUBMARINE. We don't have ANYTHING else.
		------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/
		
	6.	Write a program that reads from the console a string of maximum 20 characters. If the length of the string is
less than 20, the rest of the characters should be filled with '*'. Print the result string into the console.

	7.	Write a program that encodes and decodes a string using given encryption key (cipher). The key consists of a
sequence of characters. The encoding/decoding is done by performing XOR (exclusive or) operation over the first letter
of the string with the first of the key, the second – with the second, etc. When the last key character is reached,
the next is the first.

	8.	Write a program that extracts from a given text all sentences containing given word.

	Example: The word is "in". The text is:
		/------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			We are living in a yellow submarine. We don't have anything else. Inside the submarine is very tight.
			So we are drinking all the day. We will move out of it in 5 days.
		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/
	The expected result is:
		/------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			We are living in a yellow submarine.We will move out of it in 5 days.
		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/
Consider that the sentences are separated by "." and the words – by non-letter symbols.

	9.	We are given a string containing a list of forbidden words and a text containing some of these words.
Write a program that replaces the forbidden words with asterisks.
		
	Example:
		/------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			WMicrosoft announced its next generation PHP compiler today. It is based on .NET Framework 4.0 and is
			implemented as a dynamic language in CLR.
		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/
		Words: "PHP, CLR, Microsoft"
	The expected result:
		/------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			********* announced its next generation *** compiler today. It is based on .NET Framework 4.0 and is
		implemented as a dynamic language in ***.
		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/

	10.	Write a program that converts a string to a sequence of C# Unicode character literals. Use format strings.

	Sample input:
		/------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			Hi!
		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/
	Expected output:
		/------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			\u0048\u0069\u0021
		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/

	11.	Write a program that reads a number and prints it as a decimal number, hexadecimal number, percentage and in
scientific notation. Format the output aligned right in 15 symbols.

	12.	Write a program that parses an URL address given in the format:
		
		/------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			[protocol]://[server]/[resource]
		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/

and extracts from it the [protocol], [server] and [resource] elements. For example from the URL 
http://www.devbg.org/forum/index.php the following information should be extracted:

		[protocol] = "http"
		[server] = "www.devbg.org"
		[resource] = "/forum/index.php"
