****************************  Conditional Statements Tasks  **********************************************

	1. Write an if statement that examines two integer variables and exchanges their values if the first one is greater
than the second one.

	2. Write a program that shows the sign (+ or -) of the product of three real numbers without calculating it. Use a 
sequence of if statements.

	3. Write a program that finds the biggest of three integers using nested if statements.

	4. Sort 3 real values in descending order using nested if statements.

	5. Write program that asks for a digit and depending on the input shows the name of that digit (in English) using a
switch statement.

	6. Write a program that enters the coefficients a, b and c of a quadratic equation
		a*x2 + b*x + c = 0
		and calculates and prints its real roots. Note that quadratic equations may have 0, 1 or 2 real roots.

	7. Write a program that finds the greatest of given 5 variables.

	8. Write a program that, depending on the user's choice inputs int, double or string variable. If the variable is
integer or double, increases it with 1. If the variable is string, appends "*" at its end. The program must show the
value of that variable as a console output. Use switch statement.

	9. We are given 5 integer numbers. Write a program that checks if the sum of some subset of them is 0. 
				Example: 3, -2, 1, 1, 8 ? 1+1-2=0.

	10. Write a program that applies bonus scores to given scores in the range [1..9]. The program reads a digit as an
input. If the digit is between 1 and 3, the program multiplies it by 10; if it is between 4 and 6, multiplies it by 100;
if it is between 7 and 9, multiplies it by 1000. If it is zero or if the value is not a digit, the program must report
an error.Use a switch statement and at the end print the calculated new value in the console.
